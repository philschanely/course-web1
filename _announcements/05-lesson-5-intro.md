Dear students,

I hope you had a nice weekend. A little larger of an update this week as I have a recap of Lesson 4, heads up for lesson 5 and notes about looking ahead as well.

# Recap of Lesson 4

The exercise this week was a bit more nuanced than previous exercises. I noted a few mistakes in a number of your submissions I want to make sure you address moving forward such as how to do headings correctly, and a sample of some simple, semantic organization. Please take a look at these recaps:

1\. Demo of Concentrate -- <https://youtu.be/PSmEosyZo_g>

2\. Demo of Gnoso -- <https://youtu.be/c_4f1n9rHoQ>

Lastly, several of you had trouble with paths. I believe this actually has to do with how you preview your work, especially in this exercise where there was no root index file. Watch this explanation and solution:

# On to Lesson 5

This is our last lesson HTML! You've come a long way in these last few weeks. The exercise this week is simple up front with a little more complex/challenging part at the end. _It is due on the normal day and time of 5pm Tuesday night_. Make sure to review feedback in your previous exercises in `comments.md` and the demos provided above. The project deliverable this week is also pretty straightforward if you follow the video demonstration. Be sure to check out my feedback in Moodle on your last deliverable as well in case there are things you need to adjust before moving forward.

We DO have open lab **tonight in TYL 107 from 8--10pm.** Would be happy to see any of you there!

# Looking ahead

As this is our last lesson on HTML note that we have two weeks with a slightly different schedule coming up. First, next week we have our "midterm" exam on HTML. I will send out sample questions later this week to help you prepare well. Review the syllabus to get a start on recalling the nature of the exams. You are expected to take the exam on the "honor system" and I trust you to do what is right before the Lord. _You are not allowed to use any notes, textbooks or anything other than what you have studied and stored in your brain. :)_ I will also NOT hold open lab next Monday, February 19.

The following week will be solely devoted to your project deliverable to get your site to a complete static prototype. You will therefore have a bit of a reprieve that you might use to look ahead or learn more about Sketch.

I wish you all the best this week and look forward to seeing your work in the coming days.

Sincerely,  
Prof Schanely
