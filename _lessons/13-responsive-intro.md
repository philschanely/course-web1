### Designing Responsively

After the initial explosion of responsive web design to the scene a lot more has been written about best practices, cautions, and overall responsibility with this new world of web design. Here are a few tips I've gathered from common issues I've observed from those new to designing in this medium:

* **Optimize elements in the canvas; don't just scale down.** Our eyesight does not get better when we use mobile devices, so don't expect too much to change in the size of text. On the other hand do consider the effect the size of larger text has in the context of the smaller canvas, and scale down where appropriate. And when it comes to images, making them smaller might not be best; sometimes actually zooming in and re-cropping them is best. 
* **Think about the use case.** Imagine the kind of user that might be accessing the site and in what context they might do so. What are their needs in such a context? What about the layout of the page should adjust to make room for these priorities?

### Study Tools

Prepare answers to the following questions as you study for the exam covering this module:

1. What is responsive web design?
2. How do we typically go about testing the responsiveness of a website without checking every potential physical device on the market?
3. What are breakpoints, fluid elements, and fixed elements?
4. What common devices sizes can be used as benchmarks for designing responsive stops?
