### Grids and Layout Design

One last element to address in the overall process of planning a website is the prototype.

***Read Chapter 1, pp.42–43 from Miller.***

But in order to create a functional prototype, we benefit from first creating design mockups, which aim to add style and appeal to the wireframes we built earlier in the process. A major portion of this task involves determining an effect grid system and using space well. 

***Read Chapter 3 from Miller.***

Finally, we can finish off chapters we started earlier on web design style and elements of web design.
