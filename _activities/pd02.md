See the [Project Overview and Resource](/activities/pd00.html) page if needed.

This short deliverable allows you to get the file and folder structure setup that you will need for your final site.

* Set up your site with placeholder files and folders based on the provided sitemap.
* No content is needed in each page beyond the basic HTML document structure covered in Lesson 1.

> Video demonstration coming soon!

Complete this deliverable in your project space in Codio by the deadline indicated in the course schedule.
