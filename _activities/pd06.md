title: Project Deliverable 6 -- Functional Prototype
---

See the [Project Overview and Resource](/activities/pd00.html) page if needed.

For this deliverable you will add the actual article and product content to each placeholder page in order to make the site feel complete.

Follow these steps:

1. Open your project in Codio.
2. Add your About page content into `about.html`.
3. In the `articles` folder add the content for each article to the correct page as you planned earlier in the course.
4. Repeat this process for each of the pages in the `products` folder as well.
5. Finally, add the content you wrote for your “about” page in the root folder.
6. Test all of these pages in a browser to ensure things look as they should. Troubleshoot as needed.
7. Check your full site in a browser to ensure the links are all working. At this point you should have a fully function website, even if it is a little bland and unstyled.

Watch a demonstration of how to create these list pages:
