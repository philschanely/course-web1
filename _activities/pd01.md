title: Project Deliverable 1 -- Proposal
---

First see the [Project Overview and Resource](/activities/pd00.html) page and video walkthrough to be sure you understand the scope and nature of this project.

Given the project description and outline of deliverables above, the first thing you must do is choose what your site will be about. Consider topics you’re interested in about which people are writing and that has related products for sale. You will not create an actual live site or be expected to actually own or sell any of the articles or products. Begin to collect a list of the articles and products you could include.

Submit your proposal using the PD1 assignment dropbox in Moodle.

* In the space provided explain the topic you have chosen for your project.
* If you are trying to decide between ideas and want feedback or direction, provide each idea along with what interests you about each.
* Finally, be sure to include examples of articles and products you might include in the site according to the topic you’ve chosen. Ideally, include hyperlinks to the original articles or product pages.

Submit this deliverable in Moodle by the deadline indicated in the course schedule.
