title: Project Deliverable 9 -- Content Styles
---

See the [Project Overview and Resource](/activities/pd00.html) page if needed.

Based on your design comps from previous deliverables add basic content styles to your site prototype.

1. In your project space in Codio implement a central stylesheet to control your websites appearance and link it into all your site pages.
2. Set up typography/content styles for your site as a whole based on the methods discussed in this course.
3. Check the results in the browser to ensure that the work you're doing in the central stylesheet is reflected across all the pages of your site.

Complete this deliverable in your project space in Codio by the deadline indicated in the course schedule.
