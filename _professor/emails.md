## Welcome note

Dear Students,

I’m excited to kick off Web Design I with you all this spring. This course is packed with information, techniques, and activities that are aimed to help you understand the fundamentals of working with HTML and CSS and generally designing for the web.

The course materials are now visible in Moodle, so log in and take a look! Here are some tips for getting started:

- You can find all the information and instructions for the course in the Course Website link provided in Moodle. Feel free to bookmark this link for easy access throughout the course. The homepage for the Course Website shows the course schedule and has a link to the course syllabus along with links to lessons and project deliverable instructions.
- Be sure to keep an eye out for announcement emails like this. I post them in Moodle and you should be automatically subscribed to receive them by email as well. This is a key tool for communicating throughout the course so don’t miss out!
- This week is an introductory week aimed to help you ease into the course readings and requirements. Next week the real action begins with the first activities due. Use your time well this week by completing the Introductory lesson, browsing the course website, and if possible, working ahead on lesson 1.
- There will be a few key technologies to get set up with early in the course. These are explained in the Introductory unit and there is also a supporting resources website linked in the course website that all our interactive design courses share. The first technology you’ll need is Codio, which you must eventually purchase to use for submitting coded activities such as exercises and project deliverables. 
    - All you need to do to access Codio is to click on a link to an exercise provided within Moodle. The first time you do this you'll be prompted to enter your billing information. Every time afterward you've done this you'll go straight to that activity where you'll find the instructions and space to complete the work. If, however you find you are entered into a trial period by default, please keep its expiration in mind and anticipate completing the billing so your access is not interrupted.
    - Billing with Codio should be straightforward but if you run into any trouble with the Codio billing system rejecting your method of payment you will likely need to contact the organization that issues the debit or credit card in order to authorize the purchase. ***Please set up your account ASAP as there have been some billing challenges with this vendor in the past.*** Despite some previous challenges, every student has successfully set these up in the past.
- Although this course is online and does not have any required class meetings I am very interested to hear from you! Please always feel free to email me at philschanely@cedarville.edu. I check it often and will get back to you as soon as possible. However, writing me on the same night as an item is due can reflect poor planning and puts both of us in a bind. Instead, plan to complete your work a day or more before the deadline just in case we need to have some back and forth.
- Moreover, I do not intend for you to spin your wheels on a task you don't understand. If you spend more than 30 minutes trying to work out a particular issue, stop and write me an email explaining what you're up to, what you've tried so far. I'll respond as fast as I can to help you get back on track. Some students miss out on great learning opportunities by not taking the time to reach out for help. Please take this to heart and know I'm here and happy to help!
- Note that the course's "weekly" schedule is a little odd. We’ll typically start course “units” or “weeks” on Saturdays and run through the following Friday. You can therefore use the weekends as a key time to complete the lessons (readings) and get started on the unit’s activities. You’ll typically have exercises due on Tuesday nights by 5pm and project deliverables, exams, and/or essays due by 5pm Friday nights. A few variations to this schedule are clearly visible on the course schedule.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Looking forward to getting to know you more soon!

Sincerely,
Prof Schanely


## Web 1: On to Lesson 1!

Dear Students,

I hope all is well. I've now finished grading the essays that (by the course website) were due yesterday. As we're getting into the course I understand a deadline like this may be a sudden surprise to some. If you missed it this will not have a significant impact on your grade, but take note of be sure to be on top of things moving forward. I have a few follow ups I want to share having seen some of your concerns about this course being online.

- Know that you are NOT alone. You may feel like it since you don't go to a physical class, but there are more than a dozen of you reading this same message. No doubt you know each other and are already talking about things. Get together and talk about this course too! Work on the work together and help each other. But most of all, REACH OUT to me too if you ever need help! You really only have yourself to blame if you don't take that initiative—asking for help is an important skill to develop. Also keep in mind that online courses have benefits too! You get to choose when to work on things (other than ensuring you meet the deadlines!) and everything you need for the course is documented and reviewable so you'll never miss something because you missed a class day or nodded off a bit... :)
- I strongly encourage you to carve out several regular times each week to work on this course and take them seriously as if they were class times. While this takes discipline, you can at least choose the times and locations! :) I trust you'll find that flexibility nice. Regardless, try to plan at least two 2-hour blocks that are well ahead of the deadlines to work on the work each week in addition to whatever time you need for completing course readings. Give yourself time and give me time to respond to questions you might have and everything will be just fine! There will of course be some times you'll need Sketch, a Mac program that is installed in the Tyler Building labs. But its also reasonably well priced if you want to buy it yourself and have all the more flexibility for your working location!
- Finally, I want to reiterate the "half hour" policy I mentioned in my last note. Simply put, never spend more than half an hour working on a single problem. If you can't figure out an issue in that amount of time it is likely to only continue and make you more frustrated. So don't! Stop right there and drop me a note explaining what you were working on and what you tried so far. Swap some other class's work in for a break from the problem and to give me time to respond. 90% of the time its not that you didn't understand it, but that you just had a typo. Seriously. I'm super good at finding those for you very quickly! :) And if it turns out that something does need some explaining, I'm happy to do so! Its kind of my job. :) Do your part and you'll certainly find that I'm gracious on my end. 


All right. We're now moving on to Lesson 1 in which we'll have our first exercise and project deliverable due. The exercise is a pretty straightforward one aimed to help ensure we've covered some of the basics of setting up files and folders, and some basic web-oriented techniques for naming files and adding basic document structure. The project deliverable aims to get you into the requirements and propose a topic for your course project.

As a brief side note, I enjoyed getting to know you all a little through reading your essays. Just to give you a little more information about me, I have lived in Cedarville since I graduated from CU with a BA in graphic design in 2006. I married my sweetheart and worked in the Cedarville area as she finished up her senior year---I never thought Cedarville would become our home but now we absolutely love it here. I worked at the university from 2007 to 2017. I built online courses for the University as my full time gig for the first seven years and taught web design courses as an adjunct for professional writing, broadcasting, and graphic design. The last three years of my time there I taught full time for Art, Design, and Theatre and completed my MFA in Interactive Design from the Savannah College of Art and Design. Now I work from home full time for [DockYard](https://dockyard.com) and can't imagine a job more perfect for the skills God has given me. I love coffee, pizza, Star Wars, LEGOs, and going on adventures. I have two fantastic children (Ethan 8 and Abby 6) and a foster dog with 4 Paws for Ability. My wife is a lifestyle photographer who [keeps active on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/karen.schanely/). 

I'm honored to be able to teach as an adjunct for the University and look forward to helping you all any way I can this semester. 

Sincerely,
Prof Schanely


## Web 1: On to Lesson 2

Dear Students,

Great work last week getting started in the course. Grades are in for your work on Exercise 1. You can view your grades in the Moodle gradebook and see more info by clicking on the exercise and then in Codio choosing Education > Grades. I often put feedback on any deductions in the `comments.md` file. I've also now reviewed your project proposals and you can see feedback and scores in Moodle.

Moving on to Lesson 2 we tackle some details regarding content tags and cover the very important topic of semantic markup. Be sure you're tracking with this concept and let me know if you have any questions. 

As your first actual markup exercise takes place this week make sure you are reading the details in the lesson regarding how we go about choosing how to mark elements, and watch the video(s) provided there as well.

For your project we do some basic setup of files and folders and there is a video to guide you through this. You should complete your work for this in Codio using the link provided in Moodle for your "Project Space (in Codio)." You'll continue to come back to this single space for all of the project deliverables that require coding work (some of them require separate submissions that you'll submit in Moodle or InVision... details to come). Also consider looking ahead on next week's deliverable so that you're also beginning to collect content for your site.

Have a fantastic week and let me know if you have any questions or concerns!

Best,
Prof Schanely


## Web 1: On to Lesson 3

Dear Students,

I hope you've had a nice week. Good work on the exercise and deliverable last week; we were overall on the right path; for the exercise and project deliverables see the comments.md file for my feedback if any was needed.

Speaking of paths, this week we're introducing images, links, and how to point to the desired files or locations for these using paths. Plan ahead to work on the exercise sooner than later so you have time to ask questions; this lesson has a little bit of an up curve for learning, but I promise it becomes really obvious and easy once you get the hang of it.

As always, please write anytime. I hope you have a great week!

Prof Schanely


## Web 1: Sketch License

Dear Students,

Its time to start learning Sketch if you haven't already. I draw your attention to the Support link navbar in the course website and the subsequent link to the Support Site. Here you'll find resources for Sketch to which I'll add this additional nice tutorial: https://youtu.be/qywB0JHQeC4

To use Sketch in the Tyler Mac labs, log on to a machine with your CU username and password. Then find the Sketch application from the Applications section. When you open it the first time on a given Mac you may be able to enter a "trial" mode but will eventually be prompted for the license/key. Enter this:

**SK3-2423-2054-6049-1500-9840** (use this ONLY in the Tyler Mac labs; unauthorized use may result in disciplinary action)

Here are a few other tips/reminders:

- I have videos in this course that both use and demonstrate key uses of Sketch. 
- Please start learning this tool ASAP. If you delay this from this week you will have extra to make up in a few weeks when we begin to insert images into our pages.
- Sketch is available for you to use in all the VCD labs in TYL (103, 105, and 107) and you should be able to use your ID card to scan into those rooms anytime. 
- Due to classes in those rooms the best times will likely be after 3pm on weekdays. They also usually do not have any classes scheduled in them on Wednesdays. 
- If you want to use Sketch elsewhere you will need a Mac and must purchase a license for Sketch. In my opinion this is a worthwhile investment as this tool is excellent. You can get an educational discount on a one-time license that you don't have to pay a monthly subscription to use like you do with Adobe CC. It is all around a very affordable option. https://www.sketchapp.com/ In a pinch there is a free trial you can use. However, I recommend that you save any potential need for this until later in the course when our use of the tool will be much heavier.

## Web 1: On to Lesson 4

## Web 1: On to Lesson 5

Dear students,

Sorry I'm late to get this out to you. Hopefully you're well under way on your work on Lesson 5. 

So this is our last lesson HTML! You've come a long way in these last few weeks. The exercise this week is simple up front with a little more complex/challenging part at the end. Make sure to review feedback in your previous exercises. The project deliverable this week is also pretty straightforward if you follow the video demonstration. Be sure to check out my feedback in Moodle on your last deliverables as well in case there are things you need to adjust before moving forward. 

As this is our last lesson on HTML note that we have two weeks with a slightly different schedule coming up. First, next week we have our "midterm" exam on HTML. I will send out sample questions later in order to help you prepare well. Review the syllabus to get a start on recalling the nature of the exams. You are expected to take the exam on the "honor system" and I trust you to do what is right before the Lord. You are not allowed to use any notes, textbooks or anything other than what you have studied and stored in your brain. :) 

The following week will be solely devoted to your project deliverable to get your site to a complete static prototype. You will therefore have a bit of a reprieve that you might use to look ahead or learn more about Sketch for the lessons after Spring Break.

I wish you all the best this week and look forward to seeing your work in the coming days. 

Prof Schanely

## Web 1: Exam this week!

Dear Students,

As you likely know, this is the week devoted to studying for and taking Exam 1. As indicated in the syllabus, exams include a mixture of question types including open-ended questions and portions that will require you to recall tags from memory. Please review the syllabus statement on exams and the academic integrity policy before you take this exam. 

You can prepare for the exam as follows:

- Each lesson includes numbered green boxes "1.1..." "1.2..." etc. These summarize the key points from those sections, so if you review these and ensure you're comfortable with them you're in a good place.
- Each lesson includes an additional section at the end called, "Study Tools" that lists items you should memorize such as sets of tags, and in some cases, questions or key concepts from the readings you should be sure to be familiar with. Quiz yourself on the memorization points perhaps with flash cards.

In addition to the study tools listed above, here are a few sample questions from the exam to help give you a sense of what it will be like along with some study notes:

- Describe the difference(s) between block-level and inline elements. Use examples of such elements to strengthen your description. 
(See Box 2.6 in Lesson 2)
- Describe at least 3 of the common components of webpages discussed in Miller Chapter 4.
(See Study Tools questions at the end of Lesson 5)
- List at least 5 of the organizing/grouping elements.
(See the memorization list at the end of Lesson 4)

**I regret the delay but I am updating some questions and settings on the exam and expect to have it open it for you by Wednesday.** Regardless, I will extend its deadline accordingly once it is open. I will also share final logistics for the Exam when I announce it is open.

Please email if you have any questions or concerns.

Study well and I wish you the best. 
Prof Schanely

## Web 1 Update -- On to Lesson 6

Dear students,

I hope you all had a wonderful Fall break and feel refreshed and ready to excel in your second half of the term. We now switch to the fantastic world of CSS where we get to start making our sites look nice in addition to being built well. This is where things get really fun! :-D

* Note that your exercise is the only thing due this week and is due Friday. We get back into the normal routine with Tuesday and Friday deadlines next week. 
* I am up to date on grading. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
* Looking ahead, be sure you're now getting into Sketch as you will need to begin using it for activities that are due next week. Again, see previous announcements about getting started there if you have not already. I've also added a separate announcement about creating your free account with InVision, which we'll use for reviewing design deliverables such as your style tiles (PD7) and mockups (PD8).
* **I have a very important policy I need to clarify** as we more into this second half of the term. Its called the 30 minute policy. That is, PLEASE DO NOT spend more than 30 minutes on a problem you encounter before you stop, drop me an email, and take a break. In your email, please provide details: what are you trying to solve, what have you tried, what file name, etc. I guarantee you that 90% of the time or more there is merely a typo, but they can be hard for you to spot when you've been staring at the code for too long. I have gained a refined ability to spot them from my years of reviewing student work :) And if, at the small chance it is a principle you're not understanding I'll be much more able to help you early and often than after you've snowballed a problem or tried other solutions that aren't covered in this course but you found on some know-it-all's website that neither you nor they can explain... sorry got on a bit of rant there. Bottom line: you have a life line to write me and I encourage you to exercise that sooner than later if you run into problems. Try your best, but don't spin your wheels unnecessarily. 

Wishing you all the best and will be happy to hear from you anytime!
Prof Schanely

## InVision Accoutn Setup

Dear students,
   
For upcoming Project Deliverables please create a free account with InVision [here](http://www.invisionapp.com/education-signup) using your Cedarville email address. Enter the following validation code for educational access: 56-73-13-19

As a reminder, we will use this tool for design deliverables such as style tiles and mockups and it can also be used to create simulations of interactive projects. You can log in to this browser-based tool directly to create your projects and to add your professor as a collaborator on your projects. See the support section of the course website for more about getting into this tool.

The main feature to know about is the ability to add screens to the project that you can link hyperlink together and share with others for feedback. You can upload your screen images online or by using the Craft Plugin for Sketch. 

* On your own Mac you can download and install the Craft plugin directly but you'll also need Sketch.
* In the labs the CraftManager application is installed. Open it from the the Applications folder and it should appear as an icon in the main Apple OS toolbar in upper right. Click this icon and choose to install the Sketch tools. (DO NOT try to install the Adobe CC tools as they cause problems and do not currently work; and you don't need them anyway since you're required to use Sketch!) Once the Sketch tools are installed you can click the command in the Craft manager to restart Sketch. You'll then see the Craft plugin toolbar down the right side of the Sketch interface. 
* Use the Craft plugin tutorials provided in the support section for Sketch to learn how to connect and upload to InVision when ready.

So here's a review of the process:

1. Create a project in InVision in the browser and add the professor as a collaborator on the project using their CU email address.
2. Switch to Sketch on the desktop to finalize design deliverables such as mockups or style tiles.
3. Use the Craft Plugin for Sketch to connect to InVision and upload deliverables as "screens" to a project you set up in advance.
4. With screens uploaded return to InVision in the browser to add hotspots and review feedback. 

Enjoy learning this wonderful prototyping tool!

## Web 1 Update -- On to Lesson 7

Dear students,

Nice work on the exercise this week. I hope you're back into the swing of things after a nice spring break.

**Please note there is a lot going on this week that can catch students by surprise if you're note anticipating it!** 

* This week we continue with CSS, diving in specifically to learn about styling text content. 
* This also touches on how to work with fonts on the web using Google's Fonts API. 
* We'll officially be using Sketch now on a regular basis. 
* We'll also be syncing work to InVision for the first time.
* You may find your Codio trial expires this week so please be sure to check on your billing status there!

So please start on things early this week so you have time to ask questions early on if needed! Allow some extra time for the new aspects as well.

We place a heavy emphasis on working from a design comp since this takes a lot of the guessing out of our work. So for the exercise you'll download a provided design from which to work for styling type using Sketch. It is crucial that you use this as demonstrated in the video and content in this lesson in order to obtain accurate settings for your styles! I'll be looking for type to match very closely if not precisely to the comp! Plan ahead now for time in the Tyler Mac labs. :)

Your project deliverable this week also involves using Sketch. You should download the provided Style Tile template and use the guide in the course website to build two different style tiles. In Sketch you can simply duplicate the provided style tile artboard by clicking on the name of the artboard in the design frame and then holding `alt` while you click and drag. 

Finally we'll be syncing these to InVision so make sure you watch my overview video in the deliverable instructions for help with this. The Craft plugin must be used and I provided instructions for this in a pinned announcement. It also might look a little different as the tools update over time, but the core concepts are still the same.

Good luck this week. Don't hesitate to reach out any time and remember the 30 minute rule! :-D

Best,
Prof Schanely
