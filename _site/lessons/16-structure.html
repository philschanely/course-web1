<p>In our last set of readings from Miller we looked at the early planning and research stages involved in building a website, and took a bird’s-eye look at the study of usability.</p>

<p>Now we return to Chapter 1’s overview of the planning process to look at the next steps in which we begin to conceptualize the site’s organization and to envision components of the pages.</p>

<p><strong><em>Read Chapter 1, pp.30–41 from Miller.</em></strong></p>

<p>While Miller gave many contextual examples of deliverables that are helpful in this phase, let’s debrief on each of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Site maps</strong> can be very straightforward and simple, but many of the examples Miller provided were complex. At the least, site maps should simple visualize the physical pages that will make up a site and their hierarchical relationship one to another. This provides a first stab at what could form the persistent navigation as well as an exercise in clear labeling for those pages. Remember; keep the user in mind.</li>
  <li><strong>Wireframes</strong> as depicted by Miller might look at little more like poorly-design website prototypes. But in real practice these are very useful. At the least, wireframes are black-and-white outlines of elements to be included on a given page, ideally, with simulations of actual content (although we rarely go as far as to include actual images, icons, or colors). They should not attempt to reflect the style of the site, and if any thought is given to precise placement, this should be called out. Instead, their focus is on being a communication tool. With solid wireframes, you can clearly communicate with your clients what will compose each of the pages or page templates of the site. You can also do early user testing to find out if the components are understood by users and match their needs. Finally, they are excellent communication tools for the design and development teams. Designers can get busy building mockups from wireframes while developers can base rough build outs of a site’s structure and overall markup at the same time.</li>
  <li><strong>Usability Diagrams</strong> are also often referred to as use case flow charts or task diagrams. They might look like site maps, but their focus is to imagine the process an actual user would walk through in order complete a particular task on the website. If you build these early in the process you can focus solely on the natural process a user might expect to walk through and then aim to match this process in the site’s structure through the site map and wireframes. If you build these later, they can become a feedback tool to evaluate whether the sitemap and wireframes you’ve built are simple and effective for accomplishing the user’s goals.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="anatomy-of-a-webpage">Anatomy of a Webpage</h3>

<p>With user goals, and a sitemap in mind we can begin to flesh out wireframes for the layouts of particular pages or page templates in our sites. Miller’s fourth chapter outlines the elements of a typical webpage, which are helpful to consider as conventions upon which to base our plans.</p>

<p><strong><em>Read Chapter 4, pp.112–137 from Miller.</em></strong></p>

<h3 id="study-tools">Study Tools</h3>

<p>Prepare answers to the following questions as you study for the exam covering this lesson:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Describe the purpose of site maps, wireframes, and usability diagrams/task flow diagrams.</li>
  <li>Describe each of the common components of webpages.</li>
</ul>
