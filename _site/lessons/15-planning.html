<p>As we begin a section of our course that focuses on contemporary practices in web design, we’ll use Brian Miller’s fantastic text, Above the Fold as a primary source. We begin our in-depth study with an excerpt from Chapter 1. In this chapter, Miller lays out the overall process we go through to plan a website. We’ll read just the section related to understanding a given website project.</p>

<p><strong><em>Read Chapter 1, pp.22–29 from Miller’s Above the Fold, 2nd Edition (“Miller” henceforth).</em></strong></p>

<p>Let’s leave this chapter for now in order to look more closely at what can go into understanding a website’s needs or requirements from the user’s standpoint.</p>

<h3 id="elements-of-usability">Elements of Usability</h3>

<p>A major initiative in contemporary is to focus on the user’s needs and represent them in any business discussion. This often takes a concerted effort on our part, because, ironically, business owners are often thinking about their own needs, preferences, or interests for their company’s website. Chapter 2 from Miller provides an excellent overview of the study of usability. When we plan in this fashion, we can think beyond the day-to-day grind of building sites and instead show a care for the actual experience users have when visiting a site.</p>

<p><strong><em>Read Chapter 2 from Miller.</em></strong></p>

<p>We benefit greatly from determining the business goals for a website. We benefit even more from understanding how those goals line up with actual user needs.</p>

<p>Think back to the deliverables covered in your reading from Chapter 1. SWOT Analysis can bring both of these elements together, reflecting those strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats from both the business and the user’s perspective. A Creative Brief is a great way to outline your understanding and expectations for a project to ensure you and your client are on the same page before starting.</p>

<h3 id="study-tools">Study Tools</h3>

<p>Prepare answers to the following questions as you study for the exam covering this lesson:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Describe the nature and purpose of SWOT Analysis.</li>
  <li>Describe the nature and purpose of a Creative Brief in the context of web design.</li>
  <li>Miller outlines seven broad factors that usability professionals consider. List and describe them in your own words.</li>
  <li>What is persistent navigation and what are some things Miller describes that we can do to make them clear and usable?</li>
  <li>What purpose do breadcrumbs navigation play in usability?</li>
  <li>What are some principles Miller describes for making buttons and links usable?</li>
  <li>What factors are involved in making site search features usable?</li>
  <li>How do form submissions, error messages, and the use of surprise and delight relate to each other in relation to user experience?</li>
</ul>
